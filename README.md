# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project:

### Predicting Mental Health Problems from Social Determinants and Caregiving Activities of Caregivers of Persons with Dementia: A Machine Learning Approach

#### Overview

This final project includes several files, but the **final_project_Cho.qmd** and **HTML** files are the most recent versions and are available in this GitHub repository.

The project aims to investigate which sociodemographic, caregiving, and health-related factors among caregivers are most predictive of high levels of emotional problems, such as anxiety and depression, in dementia caregivers. Using data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), I am applying exploratory machine learning methods to better understand this population. This project has been developed in consultation with my mentors, Drs. Demiris and Huang, who are experts in caregiving and biostatistics.
