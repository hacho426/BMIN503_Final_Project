# README.md BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project 

### \<\<Studying emotional wellbeing of caregivers for persons with dementia\>\>

#### Overview

This final project includes couple final project files, however, the final_project_241105.qmd is the most recent version for peer review in this GitHub repository. I will continue to update these as the project progresses.

This project aims to investigate which demographic, caregiving social strains, and health-related factors are most predictive of high levels of emotional problems such as anxiety and depression among dementia caregivers. Using data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), I am applying supervised machine learning methods to understand better this population.
