README.md

This final project includes two files: final_project.qmd, which has been updated in this GitHub repository. The most recent version is final_project241121.qmd, along with its corresponding HTML file. I will continue to update these as the project progresses.

My research focus in this study was to explore the various individual factors and social constraints faced by caregivers, and how these influences impact their emotional well-being, specifically in terms of anxiety and depression.
