# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project:

## Predicting Mental Health Problems from Social Determinants of Health and Caregivers' Features for Caregivers of Persons with Dementia: A Machine Learning Approach

### Overview

In the United States, as of 2021, approximately 34 million informal caregivers provided unpaid support to persons with dementia (PWD). As dementia progresses, individuals often become fully dependent on caregivers for daily activities. Notably, 80% of PWD receive care from informal caregivers—primarily spouses, adult children, and close friends—within community settings. This project addressed public health issues related to dementia caregiving, focusing on predicting key caregiving activities and sociodemographic features of those at high risk for emotional problems like depression and anxiety.I used datasets from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) Round 11, and National Study of Caregiving Round 4. I am applying exploratory machine learning methods to better understand this population.

The project was conducted with insights from Dr. George Demiris, an expert in dementia care, and Dr. Huang, an experienced biostatistician, ensuring a rigorous and well-informed approach to addressing the challenges faced by caregivers of PWD.
